This is a powerful training recipe that is behind some of the top models according to Alpaca Eval.\n\nGenerate a preference dataset. Extract the Lima dataset’s instruction. Sample 50 instructions. Then, use mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 to generate 5 responses for each instruction, make sure to use the appropriate chat template for llama2. Then, use PairRM to create a preference dataset. Push this dataset to huggingface and paste the link here. (40 points)\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/AmarNagargoje/preferred_dataset2 \n\nUse DPO to fine tune meta/llama-2-chat. Then, sample 10 instructions that were not seen in training and generate samples. Compare the completions from the original model (mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 and your DPO fine tuned model. Display the instruction, original model completion, and DPO fine-tuned model completion as a pandas dataframe. Then, print out the dataframe to stdout. Push the PEFT adapter to huggingface and paste the link here. (60 points)\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/AmarNagargoje/peft_model_dpo \n\n\nBonus: Iterative DPO has been an intriguing development and achieves strong empirical results. One example is discussed in the paper, “Self Rewarding Language Models”. It combines the idea of LLM-as-a-Judge with DPO trained in an iterative manner. Implement this algorithm.
